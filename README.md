# Segmenting mitochondira from astroyte with Michailovich flow

By default, running 3d_flow.py will plot the contour on slice at half depth of the whole stack.
Result will be saved to ./save/, and can then be smoothed as gheat3d.m and be plotted as shown in anim.ipynb.




For 2D data, results were plotted in 2D result.ipynb and animations were saved to .anim/2d

For 3D data, we animated the process both on a slice with 3D anim.ipynb and on the whole stack with Matlab. Results were saved to .anim.
